          <h4>To Denmark</h4>

<h5>What is this?</h5>
<p>While the larger wedding is happening in New Jersey on the 25th, we'll be doing something special in Denmark on the 29th with a small group of people. It's no secret, but the invited is a selected group to allow us to manage the entire size and reserve a few group events we have planned.</p>

<h5>When are we going?</h5>
<p>Departing late Sunday, 26 May which arrives Monday, 27 May. Please feel free to book your travel arragements. We already have our flights, so we're doing this.</p>

<h5>What are we doing there?</h5>
<p>Wednesday, 29 May is the day we ask for you to join us for as much of the entire day as you can. We have lots planned. We will also be organizing optional events on Monday and Tuesday and we hope you're able to join us then as well. Beginning Thursday, feel free to do your own thing but we'll still be around if you want to stay together.</p>

<h5>Where should we stay?</h5>
<p>The plan is to split the cost of a very large Airbnb style home for us all to stay together. There will be a deadline to rsvp for that. You're also welcome to stay on your own and we can help make recommendations.</p>

<h5>What should I do if I'm going?</h5>
<p>We need to hear from you asap. The planning has already begun and the earlier we book everything, the better. Please reach out directly, if we haven't already discussed.</p>


<!-- 

<h5>Do I have to mail back my RSVP or can I RSVP online?</h5>
<p>We may be sending out our save the dates online, but we will be sending out formal invitations with RSVP cards via snail mail.</p>

<h5>When should I RSVP by?</h5>
<p>We would love for you to RSVP by 3/30/19.</p>

<h5>Will the ceremony be taking place indoors or outdoors?</h5>
<p>All activities will be taking place outdoors. Dress accordingly!</p>

<h5>What is the dress code for your wedding?</h5>
<p>This is an active working farm, so we ask for you not to wear anything formal. For more information, please see the 'Dress Code' section back on the home page.</p>

<h5>What's the parking like at Born to Run Farm?</h5>
<p>There's enough space for up to 75 cars. But please don't drink & drive. We know you'll want to enjoy a beverage or threeâ€¦ which brings us to the next question.</p>

<h5>Will there be a shuttle to and/or from the hotel?</h5>
<p>Yes, we're working to coordinate times and will provide information during check-in at the hotel once everything has been confirmed. If you're easily carsick, we suggest driving or arranging for a cab. It's a beautiful drive, but lots of curvy backroads & hills.</p>

<h5>I'd prefer to book a cab, any suggestions?</h5>
<p>Yes, there's a cab company in the area where you can pre-schedule times. 
Cornerstone Taxi, 908-268-4008</p>

<h5>What time is the reception scheduled to end?</h5>
<p>Our reception is scheduled to end at 10:00PM.</p>

<h5>Have you reserved hotel room blocks?</h5>
<p>Yes, please feel free to book a room using the following link: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Fox/Krone%20Wedding%5ESOSLB%60FKWFKWG%7CFKWFKWQ%60109.00%60USD%60false%604%605/24/19%605/26/19%605/3/19&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes">marriott.com</a>. Please let Claudette know if there are no longer rooms available so we can get more added at a discounted rate.</p>

<h5>What type of food will be served?</h5>
<p>As most of you know, we have truly valued our time in Denmark. Our menu is inspired by our travels there and is inclusive for all palates.</p>

<h5>Will there be vegetarian food options?</h5>
<p>Absolutely! We know that there are several who do not eat meat or fish. You'll be taken care of. Make sure to let us know when you RSVP so we can get an accurate count.</p>

<h5>Will Leo be there?</h5>
<p>I think it's pretty obvious.</p>

<h5>Where are you registered?</h5>
<p>Please see the 'Registry' section back on the home page.</p>

<h5>Can I take pictures and/or post photos of your wedding on social media?</h5>
<p>You bet! Feel free to tag us or use the hashtag #thefoxandthekrone</p>
<p>We are going to request that our ceremony is phone-free (don't worry, only the ceremony). We'll have a wonderful photographer + team there to capture the moment so you're able to sit back and enjoy it!</p>

<h5>Are there any local places you'd recommend I visit while I'm in town?</h5>
<p>Absolutely! We recommend the following while you're in town:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crayola Factory
<li>Beneduce Vineyards
<li>Clinton Station Diner
<li>Citispot Tea
<li>The Clean Plate Kitchen
<li>Pru Thai
<li>Juniper Hill
<li>Circa
<li>Main Street in Clinton
<li>High Bridge Hills Golf Course
</ul>

<h5>Is there someone I can contact if I have any other questions about the wedding?</h5>
<p>Yes, please feel free to reach out to either of us if you have any questions. We want to make sure you're prepared and ready to have as much fun as we are.</p> -->
