          <h4>To Denmark</h4>

<h5>What is this?</h5>
<p>While the larger wedding is happening in New Jersey on the 25th, we'll be doing something special in Denmark on the 29th with a small group of people. It's no secret, but the invited is a selected group to allow us to manage the entire size and reserve a few group events we have planned.</p>

<h5>When are we going?</h5>
<p>Departing late Sunday, 26 May which arrives Monday, 27 May. Please feel free to book your travel arragements. We already have our flights, so we're doing this.</p>

<h5>What are we doing there?</h5>
<p>Wednesday, 29 May is the day we ask for you to join us for as much of the entire day as you can. We have lots planned. We will also be organizing optional events on Monday and Tuesday and we hope you're able to join us then as well. Beginning Thursday, feel free to do your own thing but we'll still be around if you want to stay together.</p>

<!-- <h5>Where should we stay?</h5>
<p>The plan is to split the cost of a very large Airbnb style home for us all to stay together. There will be a deadline to rsvp for that. You're also welcome to stay on your own and we can help make recommendations.</p>

<h5>What should I do if I'm going?</h5>
<p>We need to hear from you asap. The planning has already begun and the earlier we book everything, the better. Please reach out directly, if we haven't already discussed.</p>
 -->

<h5>Update: 10 March 2019</h5>
<p>We're very excited you'll all be able to join us in Denmark. Please take a few moments to read through this page and then when you're ready, click on the link at the end to give us more information that will help us plan this trip.</p>

<p>We have three topics we want to share information with you:</p>
<ul class="topics"><li>Lodging<li>Bikes<li>Food</ul>
<p>Wednesday is still the day we are planning on doing everything together. There are approximately 20 of us attending, and we'll be organizing visits to a few different locations, two meals, and a day filled with activity. Expect to be out until at least midnight, local time!</p>

<h6>Lodging</h6>
<ul class="topics">
  <li>We've found that AirBnb's are better than hotels in Copenhagen (in terms space, location, and value)
  <li>So we're looking to reserve 2 or 3 different AirBnb apartments for the group to share
  <li>Each set of travelers will have their own bedroom
  <li>Each AirBnb location will be strategically selected
  <li>If you wish to opt-out of this, or want to specify and requests, please do so on the linked form below
</ul>

<h6>Bikes</h6>
<ul class="topics">
  <li>The best way to get around the city is on bike, so we'll be taking the group to rent bikes (and accessories) on Monday afternoon
  <li>Biking is the fastest and cheapest way to get around (cabs are slow and expensive and the metro covers only part of the city and is also expensive)
  <li>In Copenhagen, <a href="https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/copenhagens-bike-culture">The biking culture is unqiue</a> and safe
  <li>But there are some <a href="https://www.donkey.bike/denmark-cycling-rules/">rules to the road to get familiar with</a>, particularly in regards to using hand signals
</ul>

<h6>Food & Events</h6>
<ul class="topics">
  <li>While you're more than welcome to spend Monday and Tuesday visting the city on your own, we'll be organizing a few different events and meals to do with folks that want to participate
  <li>You're welcome to pick and choose what works for you
  <li>Please express your interest for each in the sign up form
</ul>

<h5>Will there be a shuttle to and/or from the hotel?</h5>
<p>Yes, we're working to coordinate times and will provide information during check-in at the hotel once everything has been confirmed. If you're easily carsick, we suggest driving or arranging for a cab. It's a beautiful drive, but lots of curvy backroads & hills.</p>

<h5>I'd prefer to book a cab, any suggestions?</h5>
<p>Yes, there's a cab company in the area where you can pre-schedule times. 
Cornerstone Taxi, 908-268-4008</p>

Please let Claudette know if there are no longer rooms available so we can get more added at a discounted rate.</p>

<h5>What type of food will be served?</h5>
<p>As most of you know, we have truly valued our time in Denmark. Our menu is inspired by our travels there and is inclusive for all palates.</p>

<h5>Will there be vegetarian food options?</h5>
<p>Absolutely! We know that there are several who do not eat meat or fish. You'll be taken care of. Make sure to let us know when you RSVP so we can get an accurate count.</p>

<h5>Will Leo be there?</h5>
<p>I think it's pretty obvious.</p>

<h5>Where are you registered?</h5>
<p>Please see the 'Registry' section back on the home page.</p>

<h5>Can I take pictures and/or post photos of your wedding on social media?</h5>
<p>You bet! Feel free to tag us or use the hashtag #thefoxandthekrone</p>
<p>We are going to request that our ceremony is phone-free (don't worry, only the ceremony). We'll have a wonderful photographer + team there to capture the moment so you're able to sit back and enjoy it!</p>

<h5>Are there any local places you'd recommend I visit while I'm in town?</h5>
<p>Absolutely! We recommend the following while you're in town:</p>

<li>Citispot Tea
<li>The Clean Plate Kitchen
<li>Pru Thai
<li>Juniper Hill
