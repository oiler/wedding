          <h4>Questions We Can Answer</h4>

<h5>Where is the ceremony?</h5>
<p>Born to Run Farm
129 Mountain Top Road
Glen Gardner, NJ</p>

<h5>Where is the reception?</h5>
<p>Thankfully, same place as the ceremony!</p>

<h5>What time should I arrive?</h5>
<p>We suggest about 30 minutes prior to the start time to make sure that gives you plenty of time to get lost.</p>

<h5>Do I have to mail back my RSVP or can I RSVP online?</h5>
<p>We may be sending out our save the dates online, but we will be sending out formal invitations with RSVP cards via snail mail.</p>

<h5>When should I RSVP by?</h5>
<p>We would love for you to RSVP by 3/30/19.</p>

<h5>Will the ceremony be taking place indoors or outdoors?</h5>
<p>All activities will be taking place outdoors. Dress accordingly!</p>

<h5>Can I bring my children?</h5>
<p>Of course! There is so much space at the venue for kids to run around and play. And since it is a working farm, the venue's staff will conduct a tour for the kids to go see the animals!</p>

<h5>What is the dress code for your wedding?</h5>
<p>This is an active working farm, so we ask for you not to wear anything formal. For more information, please see the 'Dress Code' section back on the home page.</p>

<h5>What's the parking like at Born to Run Farm?</h5>
<p>There's enough space for up to 75 cars. But please don't drink & drive. We know you'll want to enjoy a beverage or threeâ€¦ which brings us to the next question.</p>

<h5>Will there be a shuttle to and/or from the hotel?</h5>
<p>Yes, we're working to coordinate times and will provide information during check-in at the hotel once everything has been confirmed. If you're easily carsick, we suggest driving or arranging for a cab. It's a beautiful drive, but lots of curvy backroads & hills.</p>

<h5>I'd prefer to book a cab, any suggestions?</h5>
<p>Yes, there's a cab company in the area where you can pre-schedule times. 
Cornerstone Taxi, 908-268-4008</p>

<h5>What time is the reception scheduled to end?</h5>
<p>Our reception is scheduled to end at 10:00PM.</p>

<h5>Have you reserved hotel room blocks?</h5>
<p>Yes, please feel free to book a room using the following link: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Fox/Krone%20Wedding%5ESOSLB%60FKWFKWG%7CFKWFKWQ%60109.00%60USD%60false%604%605/24/19%605/26/19%605/3/19&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes">marriott.com</a>. Please let Claudette know if there are no longer rooms available so we can get more added at a discounted rate.</p>

<h5>What type of food will be served?</h5>
<p>As most of you know, we have truly valued our time in Denmark. Our menu is inspired by our travels there and is inclusive for all palates.</p>

<h5>Will there be vegetarian food options?</h5>
<p>Absolutely! We know that there are several who do not eat meat or fish. You'll be taken care of. Make sure to let us know when you RSVP so we can get an accurate count.</p>

<h5>Will Leo be there?</h5>
<p>I think it's pretty obvious.</p>

<h5>Where are you registered?</h5>
<p>Please see the 'Registry' section back on the home page.</p>

<h5>Can I take pictures and/or post photos of your wedding on social media?</h5>
<p>You bet! Feel free to tag us or use the hashtag #thefoxandthekrone</p>
<p>We are going to request that our ceremony is phone-free (don't worry, only the ceremony). We'll have a wonderful photographer + team there to capture the moment so you're able to sit back and enjoy it!</p>

<h5>Are there any local places you'd recommend I visit while I'm in town?</h5>
<p>Absolutely! We recommend the following while you're in town:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crayola Factory
<li>Beneduce Vineyards
<li>Clinton Station Diner
<li>Citispot Tea
<li>The Clean Plate Kitchen
<li>Pru Thai
<li>Juniper Hill
<li>Circa
<li>Main Street in Clinton
<li>High Bridge Hills Golf Course
</ul>

<h5>Is there someone I can contact if I have any other questions about the wedding?</h5>
<p>Yes, please feel free to reach out to either of us if you have any questions. We want to make sure you're prepared and ready to have as much fun as we are.</p>
